### What's Next...

When I've completed the refresher and feel up to speed, I'd like to then get into Machine
Learning with something like Tensor Flow or similar. There are a couple video tutorials I've
seen recently and will link below:

It would also be good to brush up on my skills in these:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
