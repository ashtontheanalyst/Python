Following this tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0

Currently at time: **3:03:40 minutes**


### Project Ideas:
1. **Graphical Roth and Traditional IRA Calculator**
    -  Screen pops up for user input like principal, interest, monthly cont., and etc.
    - Calculates both the Roth and Trad.
    - Shows the yearly balance on histograms in blue and red
    - Can hover over points to see specific details

### What's Next...

When I've completed the refresher and feel up to speed, I'd like to then get into Machine
Learning with something like Tensor Flow or similar. There are a couple video tutorials I've
seen recently and will link below:

It would also be good to brush up on my skills in these:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
